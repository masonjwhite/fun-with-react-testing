# Fun With React Testing

This repository is a part of my "fun with" series. Each and every day I challenge myself to learn something new. Once I feel like I understand a subject well enough to move onto the next one, I build a small proof of concept or example so that I can reference it in the future. It also has the double benefit of serving as a great learning resource for my Bootcamp students.

Wanted to explore testing React with Jest and React-Testing-Library with Scott Tolinski's ["React Testing for Beginners Tutorial"](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/react-testing-for-beginners).

## Structure

This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app. It contains several examples of React component testing patterns.

## Starting the project

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the cloned project and run `yarn install`
3. To start the project, run `yarn start`

## TODO

No further plans for development at this time
